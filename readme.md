# Whose That Pokemon!
This is my first Project for General Assembly, to create a game with clearly defined win/loss logic. For my game, I chose to do a 'Pokemon' version of Hangman, which upon initialization would pick a pokemon from a predefined array, offer a hint, and let the user input Letters as guesses to the board.

## Next Steps / Icebox Items

- Clean up the CSS components to make them mobile friendly!
- Play audio associated with Pokemon on Win
